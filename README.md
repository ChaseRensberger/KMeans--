# KMeans++

Python3 implementation of the k-means++ algorithm, a common unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm. 

The data used for demonstation is based on the [IRIS](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

There is also a pdf of plots of some out the potential outputs in this repository but the code can be easily tweaked to provide something different.
